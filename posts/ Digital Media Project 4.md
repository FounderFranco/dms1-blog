During the process of this assignment I made a variety of changes to improve and make the website resemble me as a person.

In the beginning I decided to make the colour pallet based on shades, as you can see, the background was black, as well as the boxes that the information was placed in.

I realized that the front cover of the website must be eye catching, to capture the audiences attention, and to give off good first impression.

For this reason, I went into photoshop, took various screenshots of the three assignments we worked on, and put them all into a curved box, which really captured the essence of my creativity, as well as foreshadowing what the website will be about.
