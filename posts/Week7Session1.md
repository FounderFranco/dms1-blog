Written statement:

The objective of this project is to illustrate the concept of "change." Specifically, it represents my personal experience of moving from a densely populated city in Argentina to Australia. In the game, the player begins in an urban setting, navigates to a subway station, and then takes a train journey to the Australian outback. While I did not move to the outback myself, the setting is designed to clearly indicate that the destination is in Australia.



A brainstorm and development of some ideas for my digital environment:

In class we learnt how to intall Unity, and utilize it to create the solar system through the applications of spheres and textures.

After finishing the solar system, I decided to chnage the texture of the sun to a higher resolution image. In addition, I added a pointlight and directed it to the sun, to give it that shiny effect.
