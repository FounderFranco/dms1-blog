Written statement:

The objective of this project is to illustrate the concept of "change." Specifically, it represents my personal experience of moving from a densely populated city in Argentina to Australia. In the game, the player begins in an urban setting, navigates to a subway station, and then takes a train journey to the Australian outback. While I did not move to the outback myself, the setting is designed to clearly indicate that the destination is in Australia.



A brainstorm and development of some ideas for my digital environment:
