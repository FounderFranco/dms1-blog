I began to father sound assets the I needed for the environment, and to create a more immersion I desired. In my project I strictly did not use music, I wanted the player to strongly feel the sudden change of enviroment, from a loud and busy city, to the calm and hot outback. In order to achieve this, I added ambience sounds and made sure to make them proximity sounds, I added the sounds near key points the player had to access in order to lead them to the objective. I made sure to increase the volume of the city and subway ambience sounds, in order to push the idea of the robust change the player goes through. I kept the outback ambience sound, quieter yet smooth to the ear, almost meditative.
