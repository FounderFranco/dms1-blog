The initial day of Digital Media Studio involved grouping and deciphering a list of ten items through intriguing, riddle-like descriptions. After an engaging one-hour exploration through an outlined area of RMIT, my team adeptly uncovered all specified items. This exercise not only sharpened our problem-solving skills but also highlighted the value of teamwork in this academic field. The following images below are items my team was able to find:

An image of the "Wide machine, dispensing beverages from a far away land".
