The initial day of Digital Media Studio involved grouping and deciphering a list of ten items through intriguing, riddle-like descriptions. After an engaging one-hour exploration through an outlined area of RMIT, my team adeptly uncovered all specified items. This exercise not only sharpened our problem-solving skills but also highlighted the value of teamwork in this academic field. The following images below are items my team was able to find:

An image of the "Wide machine, dispensing beverages from a far away land".

After recieving feedback from my fellow classmates and teacher, I was able to implement some changes that were suggested. Some of these changes included making the opening scenes snappier and not so lengthy, getting rid of the black screen and sound effect before the drawing and the piano playing began, and fading out the clip of the texters which then fades into the hand drawing.
