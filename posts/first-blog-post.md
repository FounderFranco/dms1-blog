The initial day of Digital Media Studio involved grouping and deciphering a list of ten items through intriguing, riddle-like descriptions. After an engaging one-hour exploration through an outlined area of RMIT, my team adeptly uncovered all specified items. This exercise not only sharpened our problem-solving skills but also highlighted the value of teamwork in this academic field. The following images below are items my team was able to find:

An image of the "Wide machine, dispensing beverages from a far away land".

After recieving feedback from my fellow classmates and teacher, I was able to implement some changes that were suggested. Some of these changes included making the opening scenes snappier and not so lengthy, getting rid of the black screen and sound effect before the drawing and the piano playing began, and fading out the clip of the texters which then fades into the hand drawing.

For the black square homework tasks I utilized various short cuts techniques, such Ctrl+C and Ctrl+V, to create patterns that fell under the themes of order, increase, bold, congested, tension and playful. As I attempted to create these patterns I thoroughly thought about how I could arange the black squares to fit the themes, once complete, I chose one of my favourite designs from each category

Assigment 2 Discussion
Designing a cohesive set of icons for a simple kids' game has been a great way to explore design thinking and creativity. I chose vibrant colors for my icons to make them appealing and easily recognizable, especially for young users. By adding black borders that turn white on hover, I wanted to create an interactive element that enhances the user experience, making it intuitive and visually engaging. This approach demonstrates my growing understanding of user interface principles and accessibility.

I also recorded distinct sounds for user interactions to add depth to my design project. Using real-world sounds, like my AirPods Pro hitting a metal table, adds a unique and personal touch, reinforcing the interactive nature of the game. Exporting the recordings and integrating them into my project has been a great way to showcase my technical skills and creativity in multimedia design. Through this experience, I'm honing my ability to create engaging user experiences and building a diverse skill set as a creative practitioner.
